== Installing on a Local Platform

=== Local Platform configuration

The following example YAML file configures two local deployer accounts, named `localDev` and `localDevDebug`:
```
spring:
  cloud:
    skipper:
      server:
        platform:
          local:
            accounts:
              localDev:
                shutdownTimeout: 60
                javaOpts: "-Dtest=foo"
              localDevDebug:
                javaOpts: "-Xdebug"
```

The key-value pairs that follow the name of the account are `javaCmd`, `workingDirectoriesRoot`, `deleteFilesOnExit`, `envVarsToInherit`, `shutdownTimeout`, `javaOpts`, and `useSpringApplicationJson`.
More information can be found in the JavaDocs for https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-local/blob/master/spring-cloud-deployer-local/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/local/LocalDeployerProperties.java[LocalDeployerProperties].

[[skipper-installation-cloudfoundry]]
== Installing on Cloud Foundry

This section contains an example YAML file that configures two Cloud Foundry accounts, named `cf-dev` and `cf-qa`.
This is useful on Cloud Foundry if you use the Spring Cloud Config Server to manage Skipper's configuration properties.

=== Cloud Foundry Configuration

You can modify the following sample YML snippet to fit your needs:

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    skipper:
      server:
        platform:
          cloudfoundry:
            accounts:
              cf-dev:
                connection:
                  url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
                  org: myOrg
                  space: mySpace
                  domain: cfapps.io
                  username: cf-dev@example.com
                  password: drowssap
                  skipSslValidation: false
                deployment:
                  memory: 2048m
                  disk: 2048m
                  services: rabbit
                  deleteRoutes: false
              cf-qa:
                connection:
                  url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
                  org: myOrgQA
                  space: mySpaceQA
                  domain: cfapps.io
                  username: cf-qa@example.com
                  password: drowssap
                  skipSslValidation: true
                deployment:
                  memory: 1024m
                  disk: 1024m
                  services: rabbitQA
                  deleteRoutes: false
----

NOTE: The `deleteRoutes` deployment setting is `false` so that "`v2`" of an application has the same route as "`v1`".
Otherwise, undeploying "`v1`" removes the route.

You can also run the Skipper server locally and deploy to Cloud Foundry.
In this case, it is more convenient to specify the configuration in a `skipper.yml` file and start the server with the `--spring.config.additional-location=skipper.yml` option.

If you use `cf push` to deploy Skipper, a Cloud Foundry manifest is more appropriate to use.
You can modify the following sample manifest.yml to fit your needs:

[source,yml,options="nowrap"]
----
applications:
- name: mlp-skipper
  host: mlp-skipper
  memory: 1G
  disk_quota: 1G
  timeout: 180
  instances: 1
  buildpack: java_buildpack
  path: spring-cloud-skipper-server.jar
env:
    SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME: mlp-skipper
    JBP_CONFIG_SPRING_AUTO_RECONFIGURATION: '{enabled: false}'
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_URL: https://api.run.pivotal.io
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_ORG: myOrgQA
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_SPACE: mySpaceQA
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_DOMAIN: cfapps.io
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_USERNAME: cf-qa@example.com
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_PASSWORD: drowssap
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_CONNECTION_SKIPSSLVALIDATION: false
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_DEPLOYMENT_DELETEROUTES: false
    SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_DEPLOYMENT_SERVICES: rabbitmq
services:
- mysqlboost
----

NOTE: In the preceding manifest, we bound the application to the `mysqlboost` service.
If you do not specify a service, the server uses an embedded database.

NOTE: As of Skipper 2.0, you must disable Spring Auto-reconfiguration and set the profile to `cloud`.

NOTE: You must set `SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_DEPLOYMENT_DELETEROUTES: false` so that "`v2`" of an application has the same route as "`v1`".
Otherwise, undeploying "`v1`" removes the route.

NOTE: You must set `SPRING_CLOUD_SKIPPER_SERVER_PLATFORM_CLOUDFOUNDRY_ACCOUNTS[pws]_DEPLOYMENT_SERVICES` property that binds the specified services to each of the deployed applications.

You can find information on the deployment properties that you can configure in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/cloudfoundry/CloudFoundryDeploymentProperties.java[CloudFoundryDeploymentProperties].

When starting the Skipper shell on your local machine, it tries to connect to the Server at the default location of `http://localhost:7577/api`.
Use the shell's `--spring.cloud.skipper.client.serverUri` command line option to specify the location of the server.
You can alternatively use the `config` interactive shell command to set the server location, as follows:

[source,bash]
----
server-unknown:>skipper config --uri https://mlp-skipper.cfapps.io/api
Successfully targeted https://mlp-skipper.cfapps.io/api
skipper:>
----

=== Database Connection Pool
As of Skipper 2.0, the Spring Cloud Connector library is no longer used to create the DataSource.
The library  https://github.com/pivotal-cf/java-cfenv[java-cfenv] is now used which allows you to set https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-connect-to-production-database[Spring Boot properties] to configure the connection pool.

[[skipper-installation-cloudfoundry-maximum-disk-quota-configuration]]
=== Maximum Disk Quota
By default, every application in Cloud Foundry starts with 1G disk quota and this can be adjusted to a default maximum of
2G. The default maximum can also be overridden up to 10G by using Pivotal Cloud Foundry's (PCF) Ops Manager GUI.

This configuration is relevant for Spring Cloud Skipper because every deployment is composed of applications
(typically Spring Boot uber-jar's), and those applications are resolved from a remote maven repository. After resolution,
the application artifacts are downloaded to the local Maven Repository for caching and reuse. With this happening in the background,
the default disk quota (1G) can fill up rapidly, especially when we experiment with streams that
are made up of unique applications. In order to overcome this disk limitation and depending
on your scaling requirements, you may want to change the default maximum from 2G to 10G. Let's review the
steps to change the default maximum disk quota allocation.

From PCF's Ops Manager, select the "`Pivotal Elastic Runtime`" tile and navigate to the "`Application Developer Controls`" tab.
Change the "`Maximum Disk Quota per App (MB)`" setting from 2048 (2G) to 10240 (10G). Save the disk quota update and click
"`Apply Changes`" to complete the configuration override.

[[configuration-cloudfoundry-managing-disk-utilization]]
=== Managing Disk Use

Even when configuring Skipper to use 10G of space, there is the possibility of exhausting the available space on the local disk.
To prevent this, `jar` artifacts downloaded from external sources, i.e., apps registered as `http` or `maven` resources, are automatically deleted whenever the application is deployed, whether or not the deployment request succeeds.
This behavior is optimal for production environments in which container runtime stability is more critical than I/O latency incurred during deployment.
In development environments deployment happens more frequently. Additionally, the `jar` artifact (or a lighter `metadata` jar) contains metadata describing application configuration properties
which is used by various operations related to application configuration, more frequently performed during pre-production activities.
To provide a more responsive interactive developer experience at the expense of more disk usage in pre-production environments, you can set the CloudFoundry deployer property `autoDeleteMavenArtifacts` to `false`.

If you deploy the Skipper by using the default `port` health check type, you must explicitly monitor the disk space on the server in order to avoid running out space.
If you deploy the server by using the `http` health check type (see the next example), the server is restarted if there is low disk space.
This is due to Spring Boot's link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.5.14.RELEASE/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/health/DiskSpaceHealthIndicator.java[Disk Space Health Indicator].
You can link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.14.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#common-application-properties[configure] the settings of the Disk Space Health Indicator by using the properties that have the `management.health.diskspace` prefix.

For version 1.7, we are investigating the use of link:https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/using-vol-services.html[Volume Services] for the server to store `.jar` artifacts before pushing them to Cloud Foundry.

The following example shows how to deploy the `http` health check type to an endpoint called `/management/health`:

[[skipper-installation-kubernetes]]
== Installing on Kubernetes

A docker image, named `springcloud/spring-cloud-skipper-server`, is available for Skipper server in dockerhub.
You can use this image to run the Skipper server in Kubernetes.


[[skipper-kubernetes-configuration]]
=== Kubernetes configuration


The following example YAML file configures two accounts, named `k8s-dev` and `k8sqa`, on a Kubernetes cluster.

```
spring:
  cloud:
    skipper:
      server:
        platform:
          kubernetes:
            accounts:
              k8s-dev:
                namespace: devNamespace
                cpu: 4
              k8s-qa:
                namespace: qaNamespace
                memory: 1024m
```

The accounts correspond to different namespaces.
We are investigating how to support connecting to different Kubernetes clusters.

You can find more information on the deployment properties that you can configure in https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/deployer/spi/kubernetes/KubernetesDeployerProperties.java[KubernetesDeployerProperties]

[[skipper-database-configuration]]
== Database configuration

A relational database is used to store stream and task definitions as well as the state of tasks that have been run.
Spring Cloud Skipper provides schemas for *H2*, *MySQL*, *Oracle*, *PostgreSQL*, *Db2*, and *SQL Server*. The schema is automatically created when the server starts.

By default, Spring Cloud Skipper offers an embedded instance of the *H2* database.
The *H2* database is good for development purposes but is not recommended for production use.

NOTE: *H2* database in Server Mode is not supported, only Embedded Mode.

The JDBC drivers for *MySQL* (through the MariaDB driver), *PostgreSQL*, *SQL Server*, and embedded *H2* are available without additional configuration.
If you are using any other database, then you need to put the corresponding JDBC driver jar on the classpath of the server.

The database properties can be passed as environment variables or command-line arguments to the Skipper Server.

==== MySQL

The following example shows how to define a MySQL database connection using MariaDB driver.

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
----

MySQL versions up to _5.7_ can be used with a MariaDB driver. Starting from version _8.0_ MySQL's own driver has to be used.

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
----

NOTE: Due to licensing restrictions we're unable to bundle the MySQL driver. You need to add it to
      server's classpath yourself.

==== MariaDB

The following example shows how to define a MariaDB database connection with command Line arguments

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/mydb?useMysqlMetadata=true \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
----

Starting with MariaDB v2.4.1 connector release, it is required to also add `useMysqlMetadata=true`
to the JDBC URL. This is a required workaround until the time when MySQL and MariaDB are considered to be two
different databases.

MariaDB version _10.3_ introduced a support for real database sequences which is yet another breaking
change while toolings around these databases fully support MySQL and MariaDB as a separate database
types. A workaround is to use an older hibernate dialect which doesn't try to use sequences.

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-spring-cloud-skipper-server-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/mydb?useMysqlMetadata=true \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MariaDB102Dialect \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
----

==== PostgreSQL

The following example shows how to define a PostgreSQL database connection with command line arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
----

==== SQL Server

The following example shows how to define a SQL Server database connection with command line arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url='jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=mydb' \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
----

==== Db2

The following example shows how to define a Db2 database connection with command line arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/mydb \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
----

NOTE: Due to licensing restrictions we're unable to bundle Db2 driver. You need to add it to
      server's classpath yourself.

==== Oracle

The following example shows how to define a Oracle database connection with command line arguments:

[source,bash,subs=attributes]
----
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-{project-version}.jar \
    --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/MYDB \
    --spring.datasource.username=<user> \
    --spring.datasource.password=<password> \
    --spring.datasource.driver-class-name=oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver
----

NOTE: Due to licensing restrictions we're unable to bundle Oracle driver. You need to add it to
      server's classpath yourself.
